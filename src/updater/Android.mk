# functions.

# Devices can also add libraries to TARGET_RECOVERY_UPDATER_EXTRA_LIBS.
# These libs are also linked in with updater, but we don't try to call
# any sort of registration function for these.  Use this variable for
# any subsidiary static libraries required for your registered
# extension libs.

# file then uses the .list as a prerequisite, so it is only rebuilt
# (and updater.o recompiled) when the list of extension libs changes.
