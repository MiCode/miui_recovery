# This file is the build configuration for a full Android
# build for n880f  hardware. This cleanly combines a set of
# device-specific aspects (drivers) with a device-agnostic
# product configuration (apps). Except for a few implementation
# details, it only fundamentally contains two inherit-product
# lines, full and n880f , hence its name.

# Inherit from those products. Most specific first.
